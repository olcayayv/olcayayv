## About

I design and build structured, scalable and production-ready software systems.

My focus is not just writing code —  
it’s engineering maintainable architectures that survive growth, complexity and time.

I work across game development, backend systems and mobile applications, always prioritizing:

- Clean Architecture  
- Performance  
- Security  
- Scalability  
- Long-term maintainability

## Engineering Approach

I believe:

- Code should be readable before it is clever.
- Architecture should scale before traffic does.
- Performance is designed, not patched.
- Security is a default, not a feature.
- Simplicity is a sign of mastery.

## Current Focus

- High-performance backend systems  
- Advanced Unity architecture patterns  
- Cross-platform system design  
- Writing software that remains maintainable under pressure

## Philosophy

> Build systems that outgrow their initial purpose.  
> Write code that another engineer respects.  
> Optimize what matters. Ignore what doesn’t.
